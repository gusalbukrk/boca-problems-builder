        BOCA Problems Packages Builder is a web application designed to
        facilitate the creation of problem packages for programming competitions
        administered by the contest management system BOCA. You can add new
        problems through two methods: creating a new problem from scratch or
        selecting from the database of existing problems. Once the problem
        creation/selection phase is complete, users can download the problem
        packages in the format required by BOCA.
