        BOCA Problems Packages Builder is a web application designed to
        facilitate the creation of problem packages for programming competitions
        administered by the contest management system BOCA. You can add new
        problems through two methods: creating a new problem from scratch or
        selecting from the existing database of problems. Upon completing the
        addition of problems, users can download the compiled problem packages
        in the format required by BOCA.
